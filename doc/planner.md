In this schedule everything is assumed to take very long.
We can have multiple people working at a time, people not working on the program will be writing the final report.
The individual assignment mostly has to be done at home.
I, @joshua260403, have already created a basic display before the start of the project.
Some things may not be done before deadline, this will be done at home or postponed to after the deadline, when I, @joshua260403, will continue working on the project.
